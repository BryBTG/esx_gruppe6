Gruppe6 Security job for esx based FiveM servers

Suit up and take a job from the Office, ensure the trespasser is taken care of properly or you don't get paid, but the faster you get it the done, the more money you receive.

Configurable payouts, patrols zones, peds, and scnearios, as well as station, armory, and uniform configurations. (Note if anyone can get a list or do a PR for female clothing that looks good that would be wonderful)

If you happen to get stopped by Police, make sure to show them your Security Badge so they can easily verify you are a registered guard.

Download esx_gruppe6-master.zip. Extract esx_gruppe6-master folder and rename to esx_gruppe6. Make sure to import esx_gruppe6.SQL into your main database table. Place the esx_gruppe6 folder into your server's \resources directory. Add "start esx_gruppe6" into your server.cfg, preferably around new resources, or around your jobs, but where ever you like honestly. Restart your server. Enjoy stopping trespassers.

If you want a few actual Gruppe6 cars you should go download this pack https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-gruppe6-security-cars-addon-pack/52574 and turn the Config.UseCarPack to true, it will replace the dilettante2 (Car), the contender (SUV), and bifta (Buggy) with vehicles that have active amber lights, slightly more versatility, and all around an amazing look.
